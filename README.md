# skeleto - A bare bone, simple framework for WordPress themes

This theme has the most basic stuff in place so you can get started with building spectacular themes. It is called skeleto because it doesn't have any styling or fancy-pants design. Only the very basic is included to keep things small, simple and fast.

## How to use?

**NOTE:** If you are not familiar with WordPress theme development then [underscores](http://underscores.me/) is probably better for you.

As with underscores, all you have to do is: 

- rename all files that are named `skeleto` with the theme name of your choice. At the moment this should only be `skeleto.css`
- Do a search and replace in all files and replace `skeleto` with the theme name of your choice.
- Make your own theme!

## Demo

No demo yet. It is not really nessecary either because the aestethics and functionality is extremely basic.
